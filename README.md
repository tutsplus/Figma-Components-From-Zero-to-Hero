# Figma Components: From Zero to Hero
Accompanying source files for Tuts+ course: Figma Components: From Zero to Hero

Components in UI design are regular elements, like buttons or forms, and they can be reused multiple times throughout the design process. Working with Figma components means you don’t need to recreate an element each time you need one; you can reuse components from the library. Any changes you make to the main component are then passed down to all the instances within your design. In this course you‘ll learn everything you need to know about Figma components.
